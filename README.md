# Space Project

I started writing this game for fun when I was back in school in 2015. I have recently found the source files lost somewhere in an old HDD.

The objective is to finish this game for practicing/academic purposes. A demo of the game can be downloaded from https://github.com/GhostFinn/SpaceProject/releases


## Built With

* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) - Framework used to write the game
* [JsonCPP](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) - JSON reader; Required to load sprites


## Author

* **Felipe Anargyrou** - [FAnargyrou](https://github.com/FAnargyrou)


## Acknowledgments

* Big thanks to my Physics teacher Paulo, I have lost contact with him when I left school but he was and still is a great inspiration to me. He helped me figure out some of the mechanics for the game all those years ago.
