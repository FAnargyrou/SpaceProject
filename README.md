# Space Project

I started writing this game for fun when I was back in school in 2014. I have recently found the source files lost somewhere in an old HDD.

The objective is to finish this game for practicing/academic purposes. I will be adding instructions on how to debug this code once I have reviewed it properly.


## Built With

* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) - Framework used to write the game
* [JsonCPP](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) - JSON reader; Required to load sprites


## Author

* **Felipe Anargyrou** - [GhostFinn](https://github.com/GhostFinn)


## Acknowledgments

* Massive shout out to my Physics teacher Paulo, I have lost contact with him when I left school but he was and still is a great inspiration to me. He helped me figure out some of the mechanics for the game all those years ago.
